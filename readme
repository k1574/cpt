# Synopsis

Catpoint  is  a  simple viewer of text files written in curses.  Further
documentation comes in a series of slides.  Just do:

    $ make && ./catpoint showoff/*.txt

## Pointtools

Check out

	http://git.r-36.net/pointtools

How to easily create a presentation for catpoint from some md file is then:

	% $EDITOR presentation.md
	% cat presentation.md | md2point
	% catpoint *.txt

This will greatly speed up your productivity.

## Usage

    catpoint file.txt

## License

In  2017  I  simply  took over catpoint and relicensed it under GPLv3 to
protect it against military and villain Open Source  customers.  If  the
original  author does not like this, contact me at my e‚Äêmail address and
will find a solution.

## Bugs

Have fun!
